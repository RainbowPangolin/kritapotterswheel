# Krita Potter's Wheel Plugin

## Overview

You might have seen those videos of artists painting onto spinning pottery wheels. This plugin rotates the canvas continuously, allowing you to achieve the same effect.

## FAQ


- How does this work?
  - This plugin gives you two buttons to start and stop the rotation, and a slider to change the speed of the rotation. When you press start, the canvas immediately starts rotating, and you can draw onto the spinning canvas.


## Known issues

- My lines are jittery!
  - Due to the way the plugin currently works (using Krita's inbuilt rotation system to rotate a tiny amount every few milliseconds), this is unavoidable. **Use the brush stabilizer to smooth out the lines.** I'm working on a solution to make raw inputs nicer, but it will take time.
